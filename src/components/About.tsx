                <p className='text-xl mx-4 mt-10 indent-10 leading-9'>Technology has never had room for complancency, and the pace of its evolution has only ever fueled my curiousity— along with everyone else's of course. Throughout my journey of aquiring greater capabilities as a web developer, I realized it came with greater responsibility to also partake in shaping the future of the web. Thus, the dedication of creating innovative and user-friendly solutions has been deeply-rooted, while my thirst for knoweledge has only continued to grow. </p>

                <p className='text-xl mx-4 indent-10 leading-9'>My name is Joseph Quintiliano, and I'm from Media, PA. Being raised within a small family-owned resrauant, I naturally recognized the core prinicples of integrity, transparent communication, and the importance of positive elevation within any community. Upon graduating high school in 2017, I had the privliage of becoming a student-athlete at Ursinus College (Collegeville, PA). Inevtably, my adaptibility strengthed when asked to devote 40+ hours a week while balancing a double major of applied economics & mathematics. But life was put to a holt in 2020, and when one door closes another opens! And so having learned the basics of JavaScript prior, I chose to delve deeper— aquiring a Full-Stack certificate from Palm Beach Coding School, a Front-End TechDegree certificate from Team Treehouse, and an established foundation for high-level preprocessors and libraries within certain languages and a framework agnostics. </p>
