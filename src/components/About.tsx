I was raised within the family restaruant, and so I naturally developed the core prinicples of respect, transparent communication, and elevation of a community. Graduting high school in 2017, I had the privliage to play lacrosse at the collegaite level. I attended Ursinus College, devoting 40+ hours a week balancing a double major. But life was put to a holt in 2020 and with one door closed, another open. Having learned the basics of JavaScript prior, I delved deeper aquiring a Full-Stack certificate from Palm Beach Coding School, a Front-End TechDegree certificate from Academy Treehouse, and a skillset familiarized with framework agnostics, libraries, and different preprocessors</p>
