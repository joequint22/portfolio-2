                <p className='text-xl mx-4 mt-10 indent-10 leading-9'>Technology has never had room for complacency, and the pace of its evolution has only ever fueled my curiosity—along with everyone else, of course. And so, throughout my journey of acquiring greater capabilities as a web developer, I realized it came with greater responsibility to also partake in shaping the future of the web! Thus, my dedication to creating innovative and user-friendly solutions has been deeply rooted while my hunger for knowledge continues to grow.</p>

                <br />

                <p className='text-xl mx-4 indent-10 leading-9'>My name is Joseph Quintiliano, and I'm from Media, PA. Being raised in a small family-owned restaurant, I naturally recognized the core principles of integrity, transparent communication, and the importance of positive elevation within any community. Upon graduating high school in 2017, I had the privilege of becoming a student-athlete at Ursinus College (Collegeville, PA). Undoubtedly, my adaptability strengthened when asked to devote 40+ hours a week while balancing a double major in applied economics and mathematics. But life was put to a halt in 2020, and when one door closes, another opens! And so, having learned the basics of JavaScript prior, I chose to delve deeper—acquiring a Full-Stack certificate from Palm Beach Coding School, a Front-End TechDegree certificate from Team Treehouse, an established foundation for high-level preprocessors and libraries within certain languages, and a framework agnostic. </p>
