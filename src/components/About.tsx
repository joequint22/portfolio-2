                <p className='text-lg text-gray-300 md:text-xl mx-4 mt-10 indent-3 md:indent-5 lg:leading-9'>Technology has never had room for complacency, and the pace of its evolution has only ever fueled my curiosity (along with everyone else, of course). And so, throughout my journey of acquiring greater capabilities as a web developer, I realized it came with even a greater responsibility to partake in shaping the future of the web! Thus, my dedication to creating innovative and user-friendly solutions has been deeply rooted within my hunger for knowledge.</p>

                <p className='text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-300 mx-4 indent-3 md:indent-5 lg:leading-9'>My name is Joseph Quintiliano, and I'm from Media, PA— being raised in a small family-owned restaurant, I naturally recognized the core principles of integrity, transparent communication, and the importance of positive elevation within any community. I had the privilege of becoming a student-athlete at Ursinus College (Collegeville, PA). Undoubtedly, my adaptability strengthened when I was asked to devote 20+ hours a week while balancing a double major in applied economics & mathematics. But life was put to a halt in 2020, and when one door closes, another opens! And so, having learned the basics of JavaScript prior, I chose to delve deeper— acquiring a Full-Stack certificate from the Palm Beach Coding School, a Front-End TechDegree certificate from Team Treehouse, and an established foundation for popular libraries, frameworks, high-level preprocessors, and framework agnostics. My goal is to not only secure a position as a front-end web developer, but to also become an immediate asset upon arrival. </p>
